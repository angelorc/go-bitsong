# Concepts

## Fan token

Fan tokens, conceptually based on the [ERC-20 Standard](https://ethereum.org/it/developers/docs/standards/tokens/erc-20), are **fungible tokens** issued for fan communities. They borns to create new connections between fans and any content creator, like star performers, actors, designers, musicians, photographers, writers, models, influencers, etc.
They enable the growth of a private and (most importantly) custom economy creating new channels for fans' engagement.
Fan tokens have enormous potential. By using them, you can build myriad applications allowing fans a deeper interaction in the artistic life of their top performers.

To provide you with some examples, you can think that it is possible to use them for creating loyalty programs to provide privileged access to exclusive content. To allow your fan to crowdfund a tour or studio album and share part of the revenue with your fans. To enable your fans with the opportunity to vote on the cities for an upcoming tour. Or even to accept fan tokens as payment for NFTs.
